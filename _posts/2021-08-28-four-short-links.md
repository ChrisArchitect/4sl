*For a while there, when I was reading a LOT of the Internet every day, I wrote down the random cool stuff I learned.*

1. [The “speed of thought”](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1260698271422570497) (neuron conduction speed) is only 110m/s, which isn’t that fast. 9 ms of latency just in your arm!  (John Carmack)
2. [Poland holds ghost election with 0% turnout](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/poland-holds-ghost-election-with-0-turnout) - Poland held an election in May 2020 with 0% turnout. The vote was not officially cancelled but polling stations stayed closed. (The Guardian)
3. [40% of new American couples meet online. ](https://qz.com/1546677/around-40-of-us-couples-now-first-meet-online/) (Quartz)
4.  "[Serotonin](https://twitter.com/CharlotteMykura/status/1258339011334230016) is known as the 'happy chemical' but over 90% of it lies within our gut, where it has a role in pushing poo along." (Charlotte Mykura)
